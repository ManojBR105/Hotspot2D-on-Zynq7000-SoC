1. Folder Hierarchy: DesignTree/Vitis Workspace/core0/src/

This hierarchy contains files related to the core of the software part.

• main.c: This file includes the main function where we called the state machine in the hotspot application.c
• hotspot application.c: This contains the main application state machine
• all the other files are generated by lwIP TCP echo example which is required for Ethernet connection

2. Folder Hierarchy: DesignTree/Vitis Workspace/core0/src/mylib

This folder contains files generated related to our custom IPs which interact with PS.

• Interrupt/: This folder contains all the functions related to the interrupt handling
• Display/: This folder contains all the display drivers
• Counter/: This folder contains all the counter drivers(e.g., read counter, reset counter, enable counter)
• data handler/: This folder contains functions related to the decoding and storing of data received via Ethernet
• constants.h: hold the address, machine states, and other constants used in the program

3. Folder Hierarchy: DesignTree/Vitis Workspace/core1/src/

This hierarchy contains files related to the core1 of the software part.

• main.c: This file includes the main function and all the functions like the DMA controller, software hotspot computation
• hotspot ccomputation.h : This file contains all the constants related to the hotspot computation (e.g., chip parameters)
• constants.h: Hold the address, machine states, and other constants used in the program
• All the other files are generated by Xilinx for hello world project

4. Folder Hierarchy: DesignTree/Vivado/

This hierarchy contains files related to our Vivado Project.

• design stage1 wrapper.xsa: This is the final .xsa file exported by the Vivado project.
• design stage1 wrapper.xpr: This is the vivado project file.

5. Folder Hierarchy: DesignTree/Vivado/ip repo/

This hierarchy contains files related to our custom IPs.

• constants ip: This folder includes the source files of the IP developed for passing constants used in hotspot computation.
• counter ip: This folder includes the source files of the IP developed for counting cycle count for simulation time measurement at hardware.
• sodaWithHotsPot V6 64OutQ10 54 power Q1.31: This folder includes the source files of the hotspot computation IP (including SODA)
• vga controller ip: This is the vga controller IP provided by the course tutorial

6. Folder Hierarchy: DesignTree/Vivado/project integration 1.srcs/sources 1/bd/design stage

This folder contains files related to the final block diagram.
